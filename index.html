      <p>In the year 2000, The United Nations established Sustainable Development Goal 5: “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls” and its target, bringing attention to all member countries of this important issue.>

      <h2 class="subhead">17 years later, how does gender equality look?</h2>

      <p>This measure, created by the United Nations Development Programme, is built around three dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment, and labor market participation. The lower the measure, the more gender equality a country has.<p>

      <p>Although there have been improvements, the map shows that no country has achieved complete gender equality. This represents that all countries are not harnessing their entire human potential, as pointed out by the World Economic Forum.

      <h2 class="subhead">Countries with the highest economic growth are also more equal 
      </h2>

      <p>In 2006, the World Bank pointed out that gender equality was “Smart economics”. In 2015, the case for these two variables still exists. According to The McKinsey Global Institute, equal economic participation would add 26 percent of annual global GDP by 2025.

      <h2 class="subhead">Gender quotas and economic growth don’t always go hand in hand
      </h2>

      <p>More than half of all countries now apply some type of gender quota to their parliaments, according to the International Institute for Democracy. Rwanda is an important example of the relationship between quotas and economic development. In 2003, it adopted gender balance quotas, and today has the highest proportion of women representation in politics: 61%. The country also reached 6.1% in the second half of 2017, and this growth is expected to accelerate to 7.2% in 2018 and to 7.5% in 2019, according to the World Bank.  

      However, the case between economic growth and political representation isn’t always so direct. According to the Interparliamentary Union, African countries regularly top lists of governments with the highest female representation. However, economic growth in some of these economies is still not remarkable.

      <h3 class="subhead"> Countries mandating non-discrimination also have a higher economic growth 
      </h3>

      <p>According to one study, greater female participation in the U.S. workforce since 1970 accounts for a quarter of current GDP). Another study indicates that the reduction in the male-female employment gap has been an important driver of European economic growth in the last decade. <p>

      <h4 class="subhead">Domestic violence legislation still isn’t a global reality
      </h4>

      <p>According to The Economist, the cost of violence against women adds up to 2% of the global GDP, taking into consideration direct spending on counseling, health resources, and projections of lost productivity. However, countries that do not have include domestic violence legislation also present low economic growth.
